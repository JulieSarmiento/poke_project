# Pok√©mon Project

## Description

A simple Pok√©mon project built with Django. My idea is to create a project to practice my python/django skills,
some React as well.

As for what the project does: is simple web app that lets users browse,
view details, and store Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API.

üîç Features so far:
‚úÖ Fetches Pok√©mon data (name, types, image) from the Pok√©API.
‚úÖ Saves Pok√©mon locally to avoid duplicate API calls.
‚úÖ Shows a list of Pok√©mon with names, images, and types.
‚úÖ Lets users click for a detail view of any Pok√©mon.
‚úÖ Has an admin panel to manage Pok√©mon, favorites, tags, and notes.
‚úÖ Has a frontend built with React and TypeScript.
‚úÖ Has a backend built with Django.
‚úÖ Has a database built with SQLite.


## Requirements

for backend:
- Python > 3.9.10
- pyenv if you want a python version manager
- Django 4.2.21
- requests 2.32.3

for frontend:
- nodejs > 18, currently using 22.10.0
- npm
- vite
- typescript
- nvm (optional) if you have multiple node versions

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate if you are using mac
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py runserver to start the API server
npm run dev to start the frontend server, API server must be running
```

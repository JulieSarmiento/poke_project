# Pok√©mon Project

## Description

A simple Pok√©mon project built with Django. My idea is to create a project to practice my python/django skills,
some React as well.

As for what the project does: is simple web app that lets users browse,
view details, and store Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API.

üîç Features so far:
‚úÖ Fetches Pok√©mon data (name, types, image) from the Pok√©API.
‚úÖ Saves Pok√©mon locally to avoid duplicate API calls.
‚úÖ Shows a list of Pok√©mon with names, images, and types.
‚úÖ Lets users click for a detail view of any Pok√©mon.
‚úÖ Has an admin panel to manage Pok√©mon, favorites, tags, and notes.
